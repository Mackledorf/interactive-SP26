    <p>Give me now
        Your full attention.
        I can't tell you how
        I knew--but I did know that I had crossed
        The border. Everything I loved was lost
        But no aorta could report regret.
        A sun of rubber was convulsed and set;
        And blood-black nothingness began to spin
        A system of cells interlinked within
        Cells interlinked within cells interlinked
        Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct
        Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.</p>
