        Pale Fire
    </h2>

    <h4>
        By Vladimir Nabokov
    </h2>

    <p>Give me now<br>
        Your full attention.<br>
        I can't tell you how<br>
        I knew--but I did know that I had crossed<br>
        The border. Everything I loved was lost<br>
        But no aorta could report regret.<br>
        A sun of rubber was convulsed and set;<br>
        And blood-black nothingness began to spin<br>
        A system of cells interlinked within<br>
        Cells interlinked within cells interlinked<br>
        Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct<br>
        Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.<br></p>
